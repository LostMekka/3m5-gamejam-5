# Slave Empire

* be me, a mogul
* want to extend my empire
* I need magistrates to keep my buildings managed
* I need caravan posts to connect magistrates and buildings over long distances
* and all of the sudden I am not loved by the people!
* ...
* enslave them to serve in my buildings

## how to play

* click left on the big magistrate building to build caravan posts near them
* click left on existing caravan posts to build more of them
* click left on the mogul to build defence towers nearby
* click right to move the mogul to this position
* you can only build a building near the mogul
* the people try to destroy what you build (on the shoulders of them)
* watch out for your mogul

## game over

* when you can't build anything, you have lost
